# abandoned project event-trace

This was part of hdl-compiler project, now moved to own project. Maybe I will continue with it in the future.

## ToDo

- Continue ... :)
- make better class and function naming. There is a functional difference between trace_event and event_trace which leads to confusion
- get rid of the macros used, in C++20 we have variadic templates and parameter packs!!
